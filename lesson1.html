    <h2> Biography </h2>

    <p>

        Born and raised in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire" target="_blanc"title="Austrian Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, <br>
        gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. 
        In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. <br>
        He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. <br>
        With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. <br>
        His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.

    <h2>The Nikola Tesla Company</h2>

    <p>

    In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. <br>
    Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. <br>
    It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. <br>
    The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.

    </p>

    <h2>X-ray experimentation</h2>

    <p>

    Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-rays"). <br>
    His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. <br>
    Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. <br>
    The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.

    <h2>Nobel Prize rumors</h2>

    <p> 
    
    On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics" target="_blanc"title="Nobel Prize in Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, <br>
    a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays". <br>
     There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, <br>
      "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner. <br>
    There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; <br>
     that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.
